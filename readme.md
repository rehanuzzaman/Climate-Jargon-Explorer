# Climate Jargon Explorer - User Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to the Climate Jargon Explorer, a web-based tool designed to simplify the complex language often used in discussions about climate change. This manual will guide you through the features and functionality of the explorer, enabling you to easily find and understand climate-related terms.

## Getting Started

1.  **Accessing the Tool:** To begin using the Climate Jargon Explorer, open the `index.html` file using any modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge.

2.  **Initial View:** Upon opening the page, you will see the title "Climate Jargon Explorer," a subtitle explaining its purpose, a prominent search bar, and an initial message below it stating, "Enter a term above to explore climate jargon."

## Using the Search Functionality

The primary function of the Climate Jargon Explorer is to allow you to search for and learn about specific climate terms. Here's how to use the search bar:

1.  **Locate the Search Bar:** The search bar is located in the middle of the page, clearly labeled with a placeholder text suggesting examples of terms you can search for (e.g., NDC, Mitigation, COP).

2.  **Entering Your Query:** Click inside the search bar and type the climate-related term you are interested in learning about. You can enter full terms or even partial terms. The search is designed to be flexible and will look for matches within both the jargon term itself and its definition.

3.  **Real-time Results:** As you type, the Climate Jargon Explorer will automatically search its database for matching terms and definitions. The results will appear in the area below the search bar, replacing the initial message.

4.  **Viewing Definitions:**
    * Each matching term will be displayed as a heading (`<h3>`), followed by its definition as a paragraph (`<p>`).
    * The specific part of the term or definition that matches your search query will be highlighted using the `<mark>` tag, making it easy to see why a particular result was returned.

5.  **Handling No Matches:** If you enter a term that is not found in the database, the results area will display a "not found" message. This message will clearly indicate the term you searched for and provide a link that says, "Click here to suggest adding it."

6.  **Clearing the Search:** To clear the search results and return to the initial message, simply delete the text in the search bar.

## Key Features

* **Intuitive Search:** Quickly find definitions by typing in the search bar.
* **Real-time Updates:** Results are displayed instantly as you type.
* **Case-Insensitive:** You don't need to worry about the capitalization of your search terms.
* **Highlighted Matches:** The searched term is visually highlighted within the results.
* **Clear "Not Found" Indication:** Understand immediately if a term is not in the database.
* **Suggestion Mechanism:** Easily contribute to the tool by suggesting new terms.

## Understanding the Results

Each result displayed includes:

* **The Climate Jargon Term:** Presented as a heading, making it easy to identify the specific term.
* **The Definition:** A concise explanation of the term's meaning in the context of climate change.
* **Highlighted Text:** The portion of the term or definition that matches your search query is highlighted, helping you understand the relevance of the result.

## Suggesting New Jargon

If you encounter a climate-related term that is not in our explorer, we encourage you to suggest it for inclusion. To do this:

1.  When a search returns a "not found" message, you will see a link: "Click here to suggest adding it."

2.  Clicking this link will open a new tab or window, directing you to a Google Form.

3.  Fill out the form with the term you would like to suggest and any relevant information you think would be helpful for its definition.

4.  Submit the form. Your suggestions will be reviewed, and relevant terms may be added to the database in future updates.
